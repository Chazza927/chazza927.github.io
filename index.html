                        <h2>Why Use These Recipies?</h2>
                    </header>
                    <main>
                        <p>As a recent graduate, one of the biggest challenges I faced at univeristy outside of the curriculem was eating healthy nutritious food. Something most students struggle with during their first spell living away from home is finances. The student loan just doesn't cover all the costs of living at univeristy so this website was created to help fellow students eat well for low costs. These recipies are affordable and alot cheaper in contrast to the standard take out, along with being more exciting than the standard pasta meal of the sterotypical student. Scroll down the page to get a brief overview of the dishes and  click the links to get cooking! These helped me when I was at univeristy and it is my hope that these shall serve you well too. These recipies include a diverse range of foods spanning from creating your own pizzas to the British classic toad in the hole to the sweet treat of a victoria sponge cake. Enjoy!</p>
